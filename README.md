# Quiz Application

---

## Overview

The **Quiz Application** is a Spring Boot–based backend system built to streamline quiz creation, management, and evaluation. It provides robust APIs to enable smooth operations of quizzes, questions, and scoring, supporting scalable and reliable functionality.

---

## Key Highlights

- **Efficient Quiz Management:** Developed a quiz management system that improves process accuracy and response time by structlining quiz creation and automatic evaluation.
- **RESTful APIs for Core Operations:** Implemented APIs for managing quizzes, questions, and scoring using Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA, enabling clean separation of concerns and maintainable business logic.
- **Global Exception Handling:** Introduced centralized exception handling to ensure consistent, informative error responses across all endpoints, increasing reliability and ease of debugging.
- **Clear Request-Response Contracts:** Defined structured request and response models, making the API intuitive for developers to consume and maintain.
- **Best Practices in API Design:** Followed solid principles in API development—layered architecture, DTOs, validation, service layers—to improve readability, testability, and long-term maintainability.

## Technical Stack

- **Backend Framework:** Spring Boot  
- **Persistence / ORM:** Spring Data JPA  
- **Database:** (typically MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)  
- **Exception & Error Handling:** Global controller advice / custom exceptions  
- **Language:** Java  
- **API Testing / Documentation:** (e.g. Postman, Swagger)
